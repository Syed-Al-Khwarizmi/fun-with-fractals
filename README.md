## Julia Fractals

“Julia” is a class of complex mathematical functions, whose behavior, although repetitive, is said to be “Chaotic”. According to a Wikipedia article:

    Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.

According to a very simple, yet elegant explanation here:

    Julia set fractals are normally generated by initializing a complex number z = x + yi where i^2 = -1 and x and y are image pixel coordinates in the range of about -2 to 2. Then, z is repeatedly updated using: z = z^2 + c where c is another complex number that gives a specific Julia set. After numerous iterations, if the magnitude of z is less than 2 we say that pixel is in the Julia set and color it accordingly. Performing this calculation for a whole grid of pixels gives a fractal image.

Yep. That’s pretty much about it, and now we’ll see how we can actually implement all this in a very short python script.

First, we need some library to deal with the images, and another library to deal with the plotting.
